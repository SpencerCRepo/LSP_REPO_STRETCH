Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 both implement the same ETL  process for transforming a CSV file of products. Even though the product is the same, there are big differences in each assignment. The main method handled reading the file, parsing lines, applying transformation rules, and writing the output file. The data from the CSV file was handled primarily as strings or arrays of strings. In contrast, Assignment 3 separates responsibilities into distinct classes.  Each class has a single responsibility, where Assignment 2 combined many responsibilities into one flow. The Product class represents each row as an object, meaning every product from the file becomes its own instance with its own data. The use of classes improves the overall structure because each class has a clear responsibility.  This separation makes the design more organized and easier to understand compared to Assignment 2. Encapsulation is demonstrated in the Product class because all fields (id, name, price, and category) are declared private and accessed only through public getter and setter methods. In Assignment 2, there was no encapsulation since the program directly modified string arrays without restriction. I tested both programs using the same products.csv file and compared the transformed_products.csv outputs to ensure they were identical. I also tested edge cases such as an empty file, malformed rows with missing fields, invalid price values, and a missing input file.
